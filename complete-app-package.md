- Memory: Optimized for Streamlit Cloud limits

### Data Handling
- Auto-detects column variations from different tools
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Normalizes URLs for accurate matching
- Validates data quality with user feedback

### Algorithm Features
- Multi-strategy text matching (exact phrase, word presence)
- Stop word filtering for better accuracy
- Performance-based query prioritization
- Striking distance boost for ranking opportunities

## Deployment Instructions

### Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
1. Upload files to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Streamlit Cloud
3. Set main file to: app.py
4. Deploy (automatic dependency installation)
